<p>As we learned from Mike Dang, PHP can be inbeded in the html as seen below:</p>

<h4>Why Do We Need PHP?</h4>
<p>While PHP can look and act really similar to Javascript, JScript's knowledge can be limited. While Javascript is usually run in the browser(client), PHP runs only on the server.</p>

<h4>IMPORTANT: When running PHP in our html files, we'll rename "index.html" to "index.php" so that php interpreter can evaluate PHP code.</h4>

<h3> Lets Jump In</h3>
<h4>Strings and Such:</h4>
<p>As you may have noticed from the example above, the "echo" function outputs strings and needs a semicolon in order for the string to render. You can also concat using " . " between data. ex: </p>

<p> We can just as easily use the "echo" function to render math equastions. </p>
